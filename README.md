# SOMnet Family – TensorFlow Implementations

This repository contains four Self-Organizing Map network (SOMnet) variants built on TensorFlow.  
Each variant resides in its own folder and provides three entry-points: two “Plain” baselines and one full SOM-enhanced model.

## 1. FC-SOMnet  
**TensorFlow version:** 1.15.5  
**Folder:** `FC-SOMnet`

```bash
cd FC-SOMnet
