# SOMnet Collection – TensorFlow Implementations

This repository ships four Self-Organizing Map network variants written in TensorFlow.  
Each sub-folder contains two baseline scripts (“Plain … One / Two”) and the full SOM-enhanced model.

## 1. FC-SOMnet  
**TensorFlow:** 1.15.5  
**Folder:** `FC-SOMnet`

```bash
cd FC-SOMnet
python plainone.py      # Plain FC One
python plaintwo.py      # Plain FC Two
python FCSOMnet.py      # FC-SOMnet
